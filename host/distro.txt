# Which distro is best for my machines?

- Pi needs a server version
- I'd like a DE free linux so I can have openbox on all without bloat
- 64-bit for all too is a bonus.'


# The Options

- Raspbian/Debian
  - Raspbian is very easy to setup for Pi
  - Raspbian is already on Pi
  - Is 32 bit userland only (64 bit kernel tho)
- Fedora
  - Torvalds used it, Phoronix Michael uses it
  - Nasa used it (and they used RHEL) back in 2008 at least
  - Contributes to FOSS (esp. EPEL for work/enterprise clients)
  - Not LTS supported, must update once a year (according to their website)
- Ubuntu
  - Has Pi Server image that works OOTB
  - Desktop comes with Gnome..
  - Uses Snaps

# The Requirements

- Pi Hole (Raspbian/Ubuntu/Debian/Fedora only officially supported for ARM w/ Centos x86)
- RetroArch
- No DE so openbox can be used without bloat
- Samba for network sharing photos

# The Exclusions

- Gentoo (not officially supported on Pi hole)
- Arch (rolling release makes it unsuitable for )
