## Raspberry Pi 4 config.txt
## This contains optimal settings for running RetroArch and some stable 64 bit
## Linux (raspian? debian? ubuntu? arch? who knows at this point...)

# Memory (System/GPU) ------------------------------------------------

# presumably gpu_mem should be more but this is based on lakka config
# config docs say that pi 4 3d system actually uses sys memory so keep this low
gpu_mem=128
gpu_mem_256=112
gpu_mem_512=160
gpu_mem_1024=256

# default on pi 4, cpu has it's own l2 cache, this prevents it accessing gpu l2
disable_l2cache=1

# Overclocking -------------------------------------------------------

force_turbo=0
# avoids bringing tv out of standby/channel switching.. why is this is in
overclock section?
hdmi_ignore_cec_init=1

over_voltage=6

arm_freq=2000

# docs say 500 is default & 600 is the only other accepted value
gpu_freq=600

# XXX come back to this

# Display/Video ------------------------------------------------------

# lakka has distroconfig.txt with the following:
dtoverlay=vc4-fkms-v3d
# number should match number of physical displays
max_framebuffers=1
disable_splash=1
disable_overscan=1
dtparam=audio=on

# noobs includes at the bottom of config.txt:
hdmi_force_hotplug=1

# Experimental -------------------------------------------------------

# use sound over hdmi, try this if no sound over hdmi.. 
# hdmi_drive=2

# default is 4k at 30hz, unlikely to need this but just incase..
# hdmi_enable_4kp60
# forces kernel loading system to assume 64-bit, not sure if this is needed
# arm_64bit=1
# GIC-400 is used as interrupt controller, this is the default
# enable_gic=1
