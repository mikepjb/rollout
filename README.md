# Rollout

Setup a development environment with rollout.

### Usage

`bash <(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mikepjb/rollout/master/rollout)`

`curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mikepjb/rollout/master/rollout -o /usr/local/bin/rollout`  
`chmod +x /usr/local/bin/rollout`
`rollout`

### Host Specific Setup

Rollout is meant to be used on any machine that can run bash (yes even Android using Termux).

There are a few notes and setup scripts for dealing with specific hosts/platforms under `host`.
