# Design decisions
#
# Should rollout have softlinked files?
# Copy files stored inside a single sh file?
# echo minimal config?
#
# How destructive can rollout be? Could I use it on someone else's computer with confidence?
# maybe just mv to old if found? create new.. diff if diff then write over old
#
# Log what happened?
#
# How can I make output look pretty?
